	<h1>Janmashtami</h1>
		<p>
			Janmashtami is the auspicious day when Lord Krishna took birth on this planet. The birthday of Lord Krishna is celebrated with great fervor and zeal in India in August or September. As per Hindu Calendar, this festival is celebrated on the 8th day of the dark fortnight which is called as Ashtami of Krishna Paksh.

	<h3>How do we celebrate Janmashtami</h3>
		<p>
			The Krishna Janmashtami is a very important festival for all the Hindus and they also keep fast on the same day. The devotees break their fast on the next day after midnight. Also, they worship Lord Krishna by singing songs and aarti or Lord Vishnu and Krishna. Some shlokas of the Lord are also sung by the devotees. The idol of Krishna is decorated with new sparkling clothes, mukut, and other jewellery.

			<p>
			Also, to celebrate this day many Hindu temples are decorated with lights and flowers. A host of bhajans and kirtans takes place in the temples. Many spiritual places perform the dance, and drama of Krishna life.
			</p>

				Another major thing that took place during this festival is Dahi Handi that takes place on the day of Krishna Janmashtami. In the childhood, Lord Krishna was named as Makhan Chor and thatâ€™s why this event takes place on every Krishna Janmashtami in which Dahi Handi is hung on the rope at a certain height and a person has to put a hole in that Handi by creating a group of people and climbing over them.
